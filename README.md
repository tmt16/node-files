Node Files

In this exercise, you will practice working with Node, NPM, and the file API.

You‚Äôll be building a program similar to the standard UNIX utility, cat üêà.

Step 0

Run npm init to create a node project inside the project folder
Create a git repository in your project folder
Add node_modules to a .gitignore file

Step 1
In step1.js, write a function, cat.

It should take one argument, path, and it should read the file with that path, and print the contents of that file.

Then, write some code that calls that function, allowing you to specify the path argument via the command line. 

For example:
$ node step1.js one.txt
This is file one.
If you give it the path of a non-existent file, it should print that error and halt the script execution:

$ node step1.js huh.txt
Error reading huh.txt:
  Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'huh.txt'
  
Step 2
Copy over your step1.js code to step2.js

Add a new function, webCat. This should take a URL and, using axios, should read the content of that URL and print it to the console.

Modify the code that invoked cat so that, based on the command-line args, it decides whether the argument is a file path or a URL and calls either cat or webCat, respectively.

$ node step2.js one.txt
This is file one.

$ node step2.js http://google.com
<!doctype html><html ...
If there is an error getting the page, it should print that.

$ node step2.js http://rithmschool.com/no-such-path
Error fetching http://rithmschool.com/no-such-path:
  Error: Request failed with status code 404
  
Step 3
Copy over your step2.js code to step3.js.

Add a feature where, on the command line, you can optionally provide an argument to output to a file instead of printing to the console. The argument should look like this: --out output-filename.txt readfile-or-url.

Current features should still work the same:

$ node step3.js one.txt
This is file one.

$ node step3.js http://google.com
<!doctype html><html ...
However, if --out follows your script name, it should take the next argument and use that as the path to write to.

For example:

$ node step3.js --out new.txt one.txt
$ # no output, but new.txt contains contents of one.txt

$ node step3.js --out new.txt  http://google.com
$ # no output, but new.txt contains google's HTML
Make sure you handle errors trying to write to the file:

$ node step3.js --out /no/dir/new.txt one.txt
Couldn't write /no/dir/new.txt:
  Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/no/dir/new.txt'
